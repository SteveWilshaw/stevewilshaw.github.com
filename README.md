## Timeline

The timeline chart is built using the awesome [D3 Visualization Library](http://d3js.org/)

## Social Icons

The social icons are modified versions of the [Pace Social Icon](http://www.designdeck.co.uk/a/1252)

The icons are combined into a sprite map, and CSS image replacement is used to display them. Media queries are used for presenting a 2X resolution version of the sprite maps to Retina Displays. This combination of Image Replacement and Media Queries means that only one version of the sprite map is downloaded, saving any unnecessary requests.
